# Embedded device

## Hardware overview
### Sensors
- Temperature sensor (KY-001 or KY-013): To measure the ambient temperature.

- Humidity sensor (KY-015): To measure the relative humidity of the air.

- Light sensor (KY-018): To measure the amount of light, which can help determine cloud cover and daylight conditions.

- Obstacle avoidance sensor (KY-032): To detect the presence of physical obstructions, such as rain or snow, which could affect the readings of other sensors.

- Barometric pressure sensor (not included in the list of available sensors): To measure atmospheric pressure, which can help predict weather changes.

### Output devices
- Display (KY-?): To show current temperature.
- LED (KY-?): To indicate the battery level or if the solar panel gets enough energy.

## Connectivity options
- WiFi (ESP???): To connect to the internet and send data to the cloud.
- LoRa (not included in the list of available sensors): To send data to the cloud.


## Energy management
- Solar panel (KY-?): To charge the battery.
- Battery (KY-?): To store energy.

- A charge controller is required to control the charging and discharging of the batteries
  
- The charge controller regulates the flow of current from the solar panel to the battery to ensure that the battery is not overcharged or discharged.

- During the day, the solar module charges the battery via the charge controller.

- At night or when there is little sunlight, the battery supplies power to the weather station via the charge controller.
