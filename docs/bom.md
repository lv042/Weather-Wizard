# Wiring Diagram

## Wiring Diagram Graphic

The Wiring Diagram is designed using a specialized application intended for creating Wiring Diagrams.
Above the wiring diagram is an introductory text explaining what a Wiring Diagram is.

A wiring diagram is a visual representation of the connections between electrical components in a system or device. It uses symbols and lines to illustrate the wiring and layout.

## Wire alignment

All wires/nets in the wiring diagram are horizontal, vertical and/or contain 90-degree angles.

## Parts list

The wiring diagram shows the correct parts for all electronic components used needed to build the device. So e.g. resistors need to have the correct specs/colors/values. All parts have a label with the correct part name/value.

## Cable coloring

Vcc wires are colored RED.
GND wires are colored BLACK.
If you mix 5V and 3.3V logic  (e.g. Arduino Uno + WeMOS) then use an alternate color than RED for either  5V or 3.3V.

## Power rails

Vcc and GND are connected correctly to the correct power rails of the breadboard.
All parts (except the WeMOS /UNO R3) are powered from the rails.
