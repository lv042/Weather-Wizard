## Target group

The user of the WeatherWizard can be anyone who is interested in monitoring and recording weather data from a specific location. This could include:

- Farmers and agricultural workers who need to track weather patterns for crop management and irrigation purposes.

- Transportation and logistics companies that need to monitor weather conditions to optimize their routes and delivery schedules.

- Construction companies that need to plan their projects around weather conditions.

- Weather enthusiasts who want to track weather data for personal interest or research purposes.

- Government agencies that need to monitor weather conditions for disaster preparedness and response.

## Needs and Goals

- Weather resistance: Since the WeatherWizard is constantly exposed to various weather conditions such as rain, sunlight, wind, etc., the housing should be robust and weather-resistant to protect the sensors and electronics from damage.

- Waterproofing: The enclosure should be waterproof to prevent water from entering the enclosure and damaging the sensors or electronics.

- Space requirement: The enclosure should provide enough space to accommodate all sensors, batteries, and transmission technology.

- Material: The enclosure material should be robust, durable, and corrosion-resistant to ensure a long life for the WeatherWizard -> ABS plastic

- Mounting options: The enclosure should provide suitable mounting options to mount the WeatherWizard in a suitable location, such as on a wall or pole.

- Access to the interior: The housing should allow easy access to the inside to replace or maintain the batteries or electronics if necessary.

- Easy assembly: The enclosure should be easy to assemble, disassemble, and transport, making it convenient for installation and relocation.

- Cost: The enclosure should be cost-effective to ensure that the WeatherWizard can be manufactured at a reasonable price.

- Noise reduction: The housing should be designed to reduce any noise or vibration caused by the sensors or electronics, which can affect the accuracy of the collected data. (Altough there are no moving parts in the WeatherWizard by now)

- Ventilation: The enclosure should be designed to allow for proper ventilation to allow accurate measerments by the sensors.

- Aesthetics: The enclosure should be designed to be aesthetically pleasing to ensure that the WeatherWizard is not an eyesore.

The design is seperated in two floors the first floor is for the main hardware and the second is for the sensors. The reason for that is that some of the sensors need ventilation to make more accurate messearments.


# Digital manufacturing materials and methods

## The chosen device

3D printing is a manufacturing process in which a digital 3D model is converted into a physical object layer by layer using a 3D printer. To do this, the printer uses different materials, such as plastics or metals, which are applied layer by layer and fused together. 

## The chosen material

For the enclosure of the weather station, ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene).  ABS is known for their high strength, durability, and resistance to impact and weathering, making them ideal for protecting the sensitive electronic components of the WeatherWizard from the elements.

## Reasons for the selected production:

- Customizability: 3D printing allows for easy customization of the design of the weather station chassis, enabling the creation of unique and specialized designs to meet specific requirements (Altough the shape is right now very simple, but it might be changed in the future)

- Speed: 3D printing allows for fast production of the weather station chassis, with the ability to print parts on demand and with minimal lead time.

- Cost-effective: 3D printing is a cost-effective option for producing small

- Durability: 3D printing allows for the production of durable parts that can withstand the elements and last for a long time.


## Choosen software

First I used Tinkedcad, but later switched to FreeCAD. I used FreeCAD because it is more powerful and has more features. Tinkercad might be better for beginners, but FreeCAD is more suitable for more complex designs.

## Stages of the design process

I dont know how I can provide the design process without having the physical design completed.
I would hand in the assignment later, but we are required to do 3 assignments a week. It is correct that a delivery can be evaluated 2 times?

### First draft and expermenting with 3D-printing

This is the first draft of the enclosure. It is made of 15mm thick ABS plastic and is printed on a Ultimaker 3D printer. It was designed with TinkerCAD. However, the shape of the housing is fully unsuitable therefore probably a rectangular structure is better.
