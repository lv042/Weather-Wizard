MANUAL MANUFACTURING

## Requirements:
Sufficient and realistic requirements should be chosen for the manual manufacturing of the weather station case. The requirements that have the most impact on the design, realization, or use of the product should be prioritized.

## Testing:

- Physical inspection: Does the model look like the design? The dimensions are correct and that the walls are of the desired thickness.

- Fit testing: Fit the components in the case? After noticing that it is much easier to make cutouts yourself

- Durability testing: How resistant is the case to impacts? -> Drop test 

- Weather resistance testing: Test how resistant the case is to rain, snow, and sunlight. Although it is hard to test the snow in the Netherlands. -> Test if water gets inside during 60 sec of rain



- Long-term testing: Unfortunately, I did not have the time to test the case in a long term scenario.

## Prototype:
A prototype of the weather station case should be realized using manual manufacturing techniques that are in line with the chosen digital manufacturing techniques and that are available. The approach should be documented clearly, and any changes made for the final version should be described.

I had to print my prototype scaled to 50% because my orignal model was too big for the 3D-printer.

## Digital Manufacturing:
As mentioned before I used Tinkerpad for developing the casing. Tinkerpad may look rather playful, but it allows you to create very complex designs. 

## Requirements:
The chosen device, material, and manufacturing settings should be described for the digital manufacturing of the weather station case.

I have printed my work with the blablablababalbalubbluab printer. I used  0.2mm ABS plastic layers to have a more detailed result and 20% infill to make it more strong. I used the material PLA because it is strong and easy to print with. For the main development I used Tinkerpad, the development process with Tinkerpad is also described in detail on Concept document. 
To slice the model I used Cura, because it is easy to use and has a lot of features and is the slicer that is used by the Makerlab. I used the settings mentioned above and worked with support material the cutouts of the led screen and the venting holes. I also used a brim to make sure that the model would stick to the build plate. Printing the final model in detail took about 20 hours,
but only 15 were needed for the draft model.

## Optimizations:
For the final product I changed a lot of details of the prototype. First of all I changed the size of the casing, that it was also printable with the smaller 3D-printers of the Makerlab.
Instead of having printed wholes in the casing for the sensors and led, I decided that it would be better to drill the wholes myself. That way I could make sure that the wholes were in the right place and the right size. 

Not realised improvements:

Although I planned to have a waterproof casing currently it is not completely waterproof. I tried to make the ventalation holes as small as possible, but I think that I could have made them even smaller. I think the optimal solution for this problem would be ventilation that are faced downwards, so that the water would not be able to get in.

## Manufacturing Process:
The manufacturing process should be logged with pictures and/or videos as proof. All steps should be clearly logged and can be replicated, and any different aspects that need to be paid attention to should be described.

1. Design in Tinkerpad and export to STL file
2. Slice the STL file in Cura and export to a usable file for the 3D-printer
3. Put the file on a USB-stick and put it in the 3D-printer
4. Heat up the nozzle to the right temperature and wait till the old filament is extruded
4. Load your filament and wait till the filament is extruded
5. Load your files and start the print
6. Wait till the print is finished :) 
7. Remove the print from the build plate and remove the support material
8. Drill the wholes for the sensors and the led's


## Product:

The final product should be demonstrated in pictures and/or videos in all angles, showing the workings of the product. It should be described which requirements have been met and which have not. Future recommendations for improvements should be given. The product should be clean and usable for the selected criteria, and if possible, should also look good and/or be durable.
