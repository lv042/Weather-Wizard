# Research Log

In this document the current state of the research phase of the project.


## Starting out with the project

I'm currently planning to get a good general overview of Golang. I want to know how to use the language, which libraries and what architectures to use.

I found plenty of info material I want to read and watch through:

-https://madappgang.com/blog/backend-development-with-golang/
-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj77B59nkTQ

In addition to that I plan to build the new backend in a separate git repository. This way I can easily switch between the old and the new backend. 
The git repository will be added as submodule to the main project, so it can be easily integrated into the project.
