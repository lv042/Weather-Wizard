# Physical Design - Create


## Requirements

The most important requirements are for me:

- The device should be able to withstand the weather conditions in the Netherlands
- Weather Wizard should have cutouts for the sensors, button, led's and the LCD screen
- The casing should be easy to assemble after printing
- The casing should be easy to print
- Weather Wizard should provide a lot of space to be expandable with more sensors
- The casing should have a ventilation hole to guarantee accurate sensor readings

## Testing

Criteria I can test:

- The casing should be easy to assemble after printing -> You just have to plug in sensors, button, led's and the LCD screen and
glue the roof on the casing

- Aesthetics -> The casing looks nice and is easy to print

- Ventilation for sensor readings -> The casing has a ventilation hole at the bottom of the casing

- Shower test -> I put the casing in the shower, and it was still working after 10 minutes

- Drop test -> I dropped the casing from 1 meter for 30 times, and it was still working

- Space for expansion -> The casing has a lot of space to be expandable with more sensors

- Assembly -> Weather Wizard is very easy to print. The files for the 3D-printer are provided and it is easy to assemble afterwards


## Prototype

Although this prototype already looks quite good. I still want to do some changes to the casing. The changes include: 

- Merging the two smaller cases into one big case to make it easier to print and assemble

- Putting the ventilation hole at the bottom of the casing, so rainwater can't get inside the casing like before

- Removing the holes from the pr
