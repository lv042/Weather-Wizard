## Information about the code 

Program code contains comment in the top the file stating author information, license type, and goal of this part of the program and has a nice readable layout. License type is an existing license type like FreeBSD, or CC, or individual copyright (C) containing a year.

Syntax highlighting is visible.

```

```

## Macros and constants

Program code contains contains no magic numbers and all macro definitions and constants are defined in one place which improves maintainability of your code.

- All control constructs are commented. In the comments it is documented what a control construct does or why it is needed, or what decisions are made.
- All functions are commented. In the comments it is documented what a function does and what it's input and output (return value) is.
- Comments are easily readable and within the max character per line limits.

```
    
```

## Code Reusability

- There is no duplication of code.
- Libraries are used to reuse other people's program code.
- Functions are used as reusable building blocks for your own code.
- Some handy functions are placed in libraries for reuse in other applications.

```
        
```

## Naming conventions

- All variables follow the camel case convention and have names reflecting the variables' use.
- All macro constants (#define) are in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
