Economics: Who pays for the costs of climate damage?\
IoT: How Can IoT Combat With Climate Change?\
What happens when IoT comes into play?

IoT platforms have shown recently how they can help us in staying connected to nature, and harnessing resources for our users without having to compromise on environmental sustainability.

<br>
Based on the german article(https://www.magdochjeder.de/blog/digitalfarming/) about smart farmings impact on climate change.


<br>
Agriculture is highly affected by climate change and the use of digital technologies, known as smart farming, has been introduced to address these challenges. Smart farming involves the implementation of digital technologies such as sensors, big data analysis and ai to enable precise and sustainable farming. This approach has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, e.g. through reduced pesticide use, optimised crop growth and animal welfare monitoring. Examples of digital technologies in agriculture include warning apps, drone analysis, smart livestock monitoring systems and field robots. The farming industry is expected to become increasingly digital in the future.
