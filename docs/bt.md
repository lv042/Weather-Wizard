## Workshop 3 Globalisation

Portfolio Assignment

Globalisation is a political perspective that views the world as a whole.

Its cultural approach emphasizes the political and economic importance of the changing ideas of people who want to participate in a world that becomes smaller and smaller.

 

### __Why has the globalization narrative become a globally contested issue?##__

Globalization is a strittig issue for several reasons. One significant concern is economic inequality, as globalization has led to an increase in economic inequality within and between countries. Additionally, the impact of globalization on cultural identity is a concern, as traditional practices are disappearing and people worry about cultural homogenization. Environmental impact is also a major worry, as global trade and production have led to climate change and environmental degradation. Concerns have also been raised about the impact of globalization on political power and governance, with some arguing that it has contributed to the rise of a global elite that is disconnected from the needs of ordinary citizens. Overall, the impact of globalization is a complex issue, and it is important to continue to consider both the benefits and drawbacks while finding ways to address the negative effects.


### __Why do competing conceptions of 'world order' have political and economic consequences__

Basically, when different countries have different ideas about how the world should work, it can lead to some pretty big political and economic consequences. For example, some countries might want to trade with everyone and let the market decide, while others might want to protect their own industries and put up blocks to imports. This can have a major impact on international trade and the global economy.

Different ideas about world order can also affect which countries work together and which don't. Some countries might only want to partner with other nations that share their values, while others might be more interested in forming alliances based on power or resources. This can have a big impact on diplomacy and global relations.

Resource allocation is another topic where different ideas about world order can have dramatic consequences. Some countries might believe in sharing resources more equally while others might want to keep as much as they can for themselves. This can have a big impact on support and development programs, as well as the allocation of natural resources like oil and various minerals.

All of this stuff can have a nig impact on people and societies around the world. The way that different countries approach world order can affect everything from trade and resource allocation to political alliances and diplomatic relationships.


### __Could you give some examples?__

- The US and China have dividing ideas about how the world should be. The US likes topics like democracy, open markets, and working together with other countries. China, on the other hand, wants to focus more on its own power and development, and not let other countries interfere in its business. These differences have led to some problems between the two countries, especially with things like trade, technology, and who gets to be the big boss in the world. In addition, China is critical of the U.S.'s support of Taiwan.

- The Middle East is another great example of how religion has political and economic consequences. Many people believe religion should have an important part in the government, while others believe it should be kept separate. Some governments try to seek complete control over everything, while others want individuals to have greater voice. These disparities may lead to a lot of stress and conflict between countries, making it difficult to collaborate in between a country and with other nations.


### __Imagine for a moment that you run a business that produces the product you have in mind for the Internet of Things.__

- If I owned a business that made a IOT product, globalisation would definitely affect us. On the one hand, we might be able to reach a lot more customers and markets around the world, which could be really great for business. We could work with partners and suppliers from different parts of the world, and maybe even set up factories in different countries to save on costs.

On the other hand, globalisation could also make things more complicated for us. We might have to deal with different rules and regulations in different countries, which could be a real headache. We might also have to compete with companies from all over the world, which could be tough to manage. And if there were any global economic problems, like a recession, that could really hurt our business.

One thing we'd have to think about is how to balance all the different factors involved in globalisation. We'd need to figure out the best way to reach new markets while also dealing with all the challenges that come with it. It wouldn't be easy, but it could be really rewarding if we got it right.

## Workshop 4 Access China

 

As we speak China is investing heavily in the Internet of Things. Mainly with investments in cutting edge technologies. 

Will China come to dominate the IoT industry in the foreseeable future? 

China's Potential Dominance in the IoT Industry

China has shown a lot of potential for domination the Internet of Things in the near future.
One of the major goals of China is to invest heavily in advanced technologies and infrastructure, which is 
crucial for the IoT industry. Iot is one of the most important technologies in the world today, and China is
investing heavily in it. China is also investing heavily in the development of smart cities, which is another
important aspect of the IoT industry.

Yet, competition in the IoT business is severe, with other areas such as the United States and Europe spending considerably in technology and research as well. While China's vast consumer market has the potential to fuel IoT growth, worldwide domination is not guaranteed, since it will be determined by variables such as innovation, investment, and market acceptance.

To summarize, China has the potential to dominate the IoT sector, but forecasting absolute dominance is difficult owing to the competitive character of the market and the inclusion of other powerful competitors.



Will this be a threat?

If China were to dominate the IoT business, it would bring both possibilities and risks on a global scale. On the one hand, China's dominance may result in lower-cost IoT devices and improved access to technology for people all over the world, fostering global connectedness and technical progress.

On the other side, issues about data privacy, security, and future geopolitical tensions relating to control and influence over the IoT industry may develop. As IoT devices create massive volumes of data, the processing and storage of this information may become a crucial concern, especially if it falls under the control of a single dominating entity.

Find an article (or two) that shed a light on these two questions. Read the article(s)  and write a brief commentary (50-100 words):

Chosen Article: https://www.iresearchchina.com/content/details8_69333.html

The "2022 China's IoT Market Report" by iResearch gives an in-depth examination of China's rapidly rising IoT business. China's IoT sector is evolving at a surprising rate, owing to the country's enormous population, extensive industrial structure, and economic development. Nonetheless, the research emphasizes that China continues to lag behind the United States in IoT technology and ecology, owing to a lack of growth in fundamental core technologies. 
Chinese IoT breakthroughs are centered on the application layer, with inadequate emphasis on basic components such as sensor chips, where self-sufficiency is barely 10%.

The report's primary result is the predicted increase in the number of IoT-connected devices in China. With the commercialization of 5G technology and the increasing spread of industrial IoT, the number of linked devices is expected to reach 15.6 billion by 2025. Its expansion can be ascribed to the advancement of communication connection technologies like as 5G and LPWAN, which have enabled multi-scenario and multi-device connections. However, the report identifies challenges in the Chinese IoT industry, such as structural oversupply and coexisting shortages, low profitability of IoT enterprises, and the need for improvement in IoT-related chip design capabilities and professional solutions for businesses.

Going ahead, the article identifies a key trend in the IoT industry: the convergence of IoT, privacy computing, and blockchain technologies across numerous industries. The market requirement for data value mining and data security circulation is becoming more pressing as the number of IoT-connected devices and the volume of data created continues to grow. The industry can balance data security and data value extraction by merging privacy computing with blockchain technology, opening up new potential in the IoT ecosystem. This integration is considered to be critical in defining China's IoT sector and releasing its full potential.

## Workshop 5 IoT and Global Business

 

Assignment: Intercultural Business Communication

This workshop seeks to provide a guide to working and communicating across cultures, and explains how your culture and language affect the ways in which you think and respond.

 

The successful (IT) professionals of the future will be the culturally sensitive ones.

We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before. We do not yet know just how it will unfold, but one thing is clear: the response to it must be integrated and comprehensive, involving all stakeholders of the global polity, from the public and private sectors to academia and civil society.

How to  gain competitive advantage when you apply strategies that deal with the cultural differences you will encounter in any international business setting.

Please explain briefly your own interest in Intercultural Business Communication.
How does Intercultural Business Communication link to your IoT studies? Please give some ideas of how you could combine or apply business perspective to your selected field of studies.
What was especially interesting or even surprising for you in this material? Please choose two topics, and discuss them briefly.


My curiosity with the various ways individuals from different cultures communicate and collaborate in a global corporate context fuels my interest in Intercultural Business Communication. Understanding these subtleties is becoming increasingly vital for effective interactions and agreements as the globe gets more interconnected.

Because IoT technologies are being deployed internationally, Intercultural Business Communication is very pertinent to my IoT study. By incorporating a commercial perspective into my research, I will be able to better understand how cultural variations may influence the acceptance, implementation, and use of IoT solutions in various locations. This comprehension will allow me to develop more culturally sensitive and successful IoT apps, assuring their success in a variety of industries.

Two subjects in the material that piqued my interest were Geert Hofstede's cultural elements and the IoT viewpoints of various global entities. Hofstede's model provides useful insights into the cultural variations that influence international business contacts, whilst the many IoT viewpoints emphasize the significance of recognizing and responding to cultural settings when building IoT technology.

## Workshop 6 Circular Economy

 

Assignment

### Describe what the circular economy is and how the Internet of Things could help to create loops throughout to recapture value that would otherwise be lost.

The circular economy is an economic system that strives to decrease waste, utilize scarce resources more efficiently, and create value via regenerative and restorative processes. Products and materials in this system are meant to be utilized, reused, and repurposed, decreasing waste and extending their lifespans. By linking intelligent assets that can detect, transmit, and store information about themselves, the Internet of Things (IoT) can assist build loops within the circular economy. These IoT-enabled items may alert users when they require maintenance or repair, enabling for more effective resource use and the recovery of value that might otherwise be lost.

### Describe how the Internet of Things could enable the Circular Economy through the implementation of technologies, with repurpose and re-use in mind, in the design and production of our products.

IoT technology can support the circular economy by encouraging the design and manufacture of readily recycled and reused items. IoT develops intelligent assets that can communicate their status and demands, allowing for effective usage and maintenance by fusing manufacturing and digital technology. Industries may decrease waste, prolong product lifespans, and build new business models based on sharing and pay-per-use by implementing IoT technology with repurposing and reuse in mind. IoT-enabled devices, for example, can be built for sharing, allowing users to borrow tools just when they are required, whilst pay-per-use models drive producers to build long-lasting and readily maintenance products.

### Explain how the Internet of Things could help the Circular Economy to grow at a faster pace.

By altering numerous industries and encouraging novel business models, the Internet of Things has the potential to drive the expansion of the circular economy. IoT technology may be incorporated into a variety of industries, including transportation, consumer goods, and energy, increasing effectiveness and reducing waste. As IoT-enabled items become more common, new business models based on sharing, pay-per-use, and product-as-a-service may arise, further fostering circular habits. The circular economy may expand quicker by embracing IoT technology and concentrating on cities as change agents, resulting in a more sustainable and resource-efficient future.
