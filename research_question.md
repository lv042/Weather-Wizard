# Research question

I want to focus in my research on the web development part. Since I was always interested in building backends and APIs, I always wanted to try the programming language Golang, 
since it's a very popular language for web focussed development. 

My research question is:

### How can Golang be used to implement a better backend for Weather Wizard?

## Why is it relevant?

Currently, we are using PHP for the backend of Weather Wizard. PHP is a very popular language for web development, but it is not the best language for backend development.
PHP is still one of the most used languages, but unfortunately it is usage is in decline for a couple years now. These are some reasons for that:

- PHP is not a compiled language: it is slower than compiled languages like C, C++ and Java

- Poor language design: PHP's design can be seen as less than optimal by some developers, due to its inconsistency in syntax and its lack of modern syntax features

- Steep learning curve for advanced features: While PHP is generally easy to learn and use for simple tasks, its more advanced features can have a steep learning curve

- Type safety: PHP is not a type-safe language, which can lead to unexpected behavior

- Security issues: PHP has a history of security vulnerabilities,


## What I want to achieve

I want to learn more about Golang to build a better backend for Weather Wizard. In the end I want to compare the benefits of Golang which it brings to the table.
A Rest API will be built because it is the most common way to communicate between clients and a backend.

## Timeframe

I will start working on the development of the backend in the first week of the research phase and will focus on the answering on my research questions in the second week. 
Building the backend in a week seems like a doable task, but I will have to see how much time I will need to learn Golang. 

## Data sources

Primary data topics:
- Comparison of PHP and Golang backend development

Secondary data topics (books, articles, websites, etc.)
- What are the benefits of developing in Golang?
- What libraries and technologies can be used for backend development in Golang?
- What is the best architecture for a Weather Wizard backend in Golang?
